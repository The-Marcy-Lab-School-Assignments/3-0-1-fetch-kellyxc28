# Question

Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - The request was successful and what needed to be done was done. This goes for all of the verbs.

2. 201 - Similar to 200, where the request was successful, except something is created.

3. 204 - The request was successful and the user is not going to be redirected to another page.

4. 404 - This means there is something "wrong" with the URL. It can be from a typo, the source does not exist, or the source is hidden from unauthorized client.

5. 500 - This represents a scenario in which the server does not know what to do with the request.
