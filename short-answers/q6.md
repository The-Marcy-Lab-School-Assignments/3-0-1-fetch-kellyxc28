# Question

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This shows whether the response was successful. To be successful, the status codes received should be somewhere between 200 and 299.

2. `Response.status` - This is the status of the response, which comes in a three-digit number.

3. `Response.url` - This is the response's URL.

4. `Response.headers` - This represents the headers of a response. Headers holds various properties and its values.

# Teacher Feedback

I want to say that response.headers returns an object with information about the formatting of the response received.
