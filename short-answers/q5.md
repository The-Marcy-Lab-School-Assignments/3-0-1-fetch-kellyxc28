# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

We pass in the URL and postOption as arguments. The URL provides the server direction or a path to where the data can be found and retrieved. I believe postOption is used for when once the data is retrieved, create something with it. Lastly, `fetch` returns a promise.
