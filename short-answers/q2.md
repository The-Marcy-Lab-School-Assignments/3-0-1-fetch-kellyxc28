# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

"Request/Response Cycle?" refers to the process of two computers (server and client) communicating. It starts off with the client sending in a request, which consists of a URL and a verb (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE). Depending on whether the request is successfully done, resolved, or rejected, a response status code can be provided. If the request is successful, data is sent to the client.

If no requests is sent by the client, then the server is waiting.
